sustain-pedal-midi
==================

This is an Arduino project which makes a electronic sustain pedal MIDI-capable.

Circuit

I implemented this on a vanilla-shield board.

Why did you make this thing?
----------------------------

Some of my favorite keyboards (like microKORG) don't have a sustain pedal jack, and I have to use [weird things](https://github.com/keijiro/sustain-pedal-ios) to overcome this weakness.

I think this is a better and less weird solution to the problem.
